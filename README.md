## Description

BASIC FUNCTIONS:
VetClinic is a prototype of a veterinary office administrative system.  Front office staff, doctors, and other specified users will have access to create, read, update, and delete data for Patients, Medicines, Doctors, and Appointments. 

ADVANCED FUNCTIONALITY:
Users can access a Medicine Dosage Calculator, which takes in Species and Body Weight of Patients, and provides a correct dosage amount.  Dosage Calculator also accounts for medicine form (injectable, pill, liquid, etc), and specifies appropriate dosage for each form.  In the next phase of development, our app will provide a printable pdf file for Doctor notes and Prescriptions given, for each Patient appointment.

Users can also create, read, update, and delete Appointments for Patients by specifying date, time, Doctor, and title of Appointment.  Users can send an email to Patient owners, notifying them of any changes to their account or appointments. 

SECURITY ACCESS:
Admin users of the app have complete access to all functionality.  Admin can create and delete new Users, and specify login credentials. Newly created Users will have only limited access to data and functionality.

This app uses MERN (MongoBD, Express, React, Node), and is hosted by heroku.
